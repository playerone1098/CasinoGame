Points considered while developing this game task:
1. 3x3 slot machine as i have used internet images but logic does not change due to this.
2. bet is of 50 coins and reward is from 0 to 1000 (baised : chances of 0 to 50 is more, then 50 to 500 and 500 to 1000 is less)
3. press the knob to start slot machine
4. settings not implemented however i have placed button click sounds.
5. Game design is used from internet and hence may be not attractive.
6. winning logic not written and coin rewards are randomly generated.
